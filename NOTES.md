# Notes

These are high level thoughts before I brainstorm the game design.

- Programming Language: Python

- Game Objects:
    - Dice
    - Players
    - Board
    - Pieces

- [ ] Breakdown the design for the game.
      - Think about how to implement multi-player modes (game requires at least 2 people and a max of 4)
- [ ] Develop backend engine that supports the game
- [ ] Decide on how to develop the user interface
      - [ ] what framework to use?
